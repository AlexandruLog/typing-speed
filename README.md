# typing-speed

The user has a limited time that he can choose to test his typing speed.
At the end of the time, the user can see a score with his words per minute (wpm) and typing accuracy (acc).

• You can choose a time period by selecting one of the options on the top-left (30, 60, 90 seconds) before you start.

• Type on the keyboard to test your typing speed and try to rewrite the generated text.

• If u want to delete some characters, u can press "Backspace", but be careful, this will affect your typing accuracy.

• If u don't like a generated text, u can change it by pressing "I don't like this text" in the top-right side.

Have Fun!
